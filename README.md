# Asymmetrik Programming Challenge - Aedan Pettit
## Business Card OCR Problem - Implemented in Node.js
### Requirements
This program requires node/npm to be installed on your machine. 
The following packages and their dependencies are required: 
* fs
* readline

Both packages should be able to be installed using npm.

### Usage
To run the program, navigate the the directory and use the command: 

```node -r esm index.js [-f filename | --file filename] [-m | --manual]```

Using the `-f` or `--filename` commands allow you to import a file to be parsed. 
The `-m` and `--manual` commands allow you to type text into the console in order for that to be parsed.
To signal that you have finished typing, use ctrl + d.
